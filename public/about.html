<h2>About Me</h2>


<p>Welcome! My name is Gautam, and this site is my digital testament to a simple, powerful belief: it is never too late to grow.

I was born in Kuala Lumpur in 1966 and have the classic profile of someone who “should” have a fixed mindset. I grew up in Bahau, Negeri Sembilan, built a career on a Bachelor’s in Food Technology from USM, and for decades, that defined my path. Like many in my generation, I was led to believe that our learning curves flatten after 50, that our roles become static.

I am here to challenge that notion completely.</p>

<p>My current chapter is inspired by Dr. Carol S. Dweck’s transformative work on Mindset. I am consciously and actively shedding a fixed mindset—the idea that abilities are static—and nurturing a growth mindset. This is the conviction that our capacity to learn and evolve is not diminished by age, but can be expanded with curiosity and effort.

This philosophy fuels my daily life.</p>

<p>My Udemy dashboard, brimming with courses from Python data science and calculus to electronics, is not a graveyard of good intentions. It is a vibrant map of exploration. While completion percentages vary (I’m proudly about 80% through an Algebra course!), each 1% represents a victory over the idea that “I can’t” or “it’s too late.”

<p>Right now, I’m fully immersed in <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/37349876#overview">Full Stack Web Development Course Boothcamp.</a> Building real projects from the ground up gives me incredible joy—and tangible proof that a curious mind can master new worlds at any age.</p>


This journey of cognitive development is balanced by a commitment to physical vitality. As a health enthusiast, I follow a high-protein, keto-aligned diet and exercise regularly, applying the same growth mindset to my physical well-being.

This website is my playground and proof of concept: that age is not a barrier, but a unique vantage point from which to learn, build, and share. I invite you to join me in celebrating the endless possibilities of a mind that chooses to grow.

Here’s to the journey ahead,</p>

<p>Gautam Dutta</p>
